# ModelingAndDiscreteSimulationProject
The dining hall system in universities was simulated. There is a multi-service and queue structure.
<b>Java and AnyLogic program tools are used.</b>

<h2> Alternative System Design </h2>
<br>
<p> In alternative simulation, we will try to see the number of service points how affect the system. So for the analyz, we will decrease the faster classical service point that servicing to students. Also some of the distributions are different from the first system.Everything else is same.</p>
